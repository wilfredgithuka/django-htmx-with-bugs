## Creating a responsive table with Django and htmx

### A fork or [JoashXu](https://github.com/joashxu/dj-htmx-fun/tree/main/djhtmxfun). Much credits to him

His original code can be found there.

## My Take

20220927  -  I couldnt manage to reproduce exactly as JoashXu did it, nevertheless it was a good trial.
20220927 -   I filled the database with random data dump to simulate the table.


Today I managed to solve the bugs, but here is what I plan to do to extend it further.

* Simplify the code
* Add some suggestive search
* Search non Latin text ie 汉字数字


谢谢！

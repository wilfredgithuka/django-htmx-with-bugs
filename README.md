## Creating a responsive table with Django and htmx

### A fork or [JoashXu](https://github.com/joashxu/dj-htmx-fun/tree/main/djhtmxfun). Much credits to him

I couldnt manage to reproduce exactly as JoashXu did it, nevertheless it was a good trial.

I filled the database with random data dump to simulate the table.
